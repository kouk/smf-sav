smf-sav-reloaded v 2.0

As the original Author Eugene Kurmanin has no interest in this widely 
used software any more, and didn't fix any bug, I release a "reloaded"
version with heavy bugfixes.

  + SMTP Callback function is now 100% RFC compliant, beeing
    able to cope with any nowadays used anti-spam-traps.
    Multiline replys / greetings are handled correctly.
    Replys split up into severaly pakets are handled correctly.
  + Race condition with two servers both using SAV is solved.
    Sender email adress is checked AFTER the data command, so any
    system doing sav on a server using smf-sav wont be checked back.    

Info for compiling: If you get a smfi_register startup error, change line 
1408 for temporary solution
